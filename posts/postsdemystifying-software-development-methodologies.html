            <p class="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-8">Published on: August 7, 2025</p>
            
            <p>Ever wonder how software companies build the apps and programs you use every day? It's not magicâ€”it's a process! These processes are called **software development methodologies**, and they're essentially a set of rules and practices that guide a team from the initial idea to the final product. Let's take a look at some of the most common ones.</p>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">The Traditional Approach: Waterfall</h2>
            <p>Imagine building a house. You'd likely plan everything first: the foundation, the walls, the roof, and the plumbing. You wouldn't start putting up walls before the foundation is poured. This is the core idea behind the **Waterfall methodology**. It's a linear, sequential approach where each phase of development must be completed before the next one begins.</p>
            <p><strong>Phases:</strong> Requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.</p>
            <p><strong>Pros:</strong> It's very structured and easy to manage, especially for projects with well-defined requirements.</p>
            <p><strong>Cons:</strong> It's not flexible. If a client wants to change something halfway through, it can be a major headache and cause significant delays.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">The Modern Way: Agile</h2>
            <p>In today's fast-paced world, flexibility is key. That's where **Agile** comes in. Agile is less of a rigid methodology and more of a philosophy. It values collaboration, customer feedback, and the ability to respond to change. Instead of building the entire product at once, Agile teams work in short cycles, called **sprints**, to deliver small, functional pieces of the project.</p>
            <p>The core principles of Agile are:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.</li>
                <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation.</li>
                <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.</li>
                <li>Responding to change over following a plan.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">A Popular Agile Framework: Scrum</h2>
            <p>While Agile is the big-picture philosophy, **Scrum** is one of the most popular ways to implement it. Scrum provides a specific set of roles, events, and artifacts to help a team follow the Agile principles.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Roles:</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li><strong>Product Owner:</strong> The voice of the customer, responsible for defining and prioritizing the work.</li>
                <li><strong>Scrum Master:</strong> The facilitator who helps the team follow Scrum practices and removes obstacles.</li>
                <li><strong>Development Team:</strong> The group of people who build the product.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Key Events:</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
                <li><strong>Sprint:</strong> A short, time-boxed period (usually 1-4 weeks) during which the team works to complete a set amount of work.</li>
                <li><strong>Daily Stand-up:</strong> A brief, 15-minute meeting where the team syncs up on progress, plans for the day, and discusses any blockers.</li>
                <li><strong>Sprint Review:</strong> A meeting at the end of the sprint to demonstrate the working software to stakeholders.</li>
                <li><strong>Sprint Retrospective:</strong> A meeting where the team reflects on the past sprint and discusses what went well and what could be improved.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Scrum's iterative and incremental nature allows teams to quickly adapt to new requirements and deliver value to the customer continuously.</p>
            <p>So which one do you prefer to use?</p>
